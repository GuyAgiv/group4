    <h4>No Warranty/Limitation on Liability</h4>
    <p>Full Moon strives to ensure that the information contained in this Site is accurate and reliable. However, Pizza
        Full Moon and the World Wide Web (or Web Site Host) are not infallible, and errors may sometimes occur.
        Therefore, to
        the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, Full Moon makes no representations about the
        reliability of the features of this Site, the Full Moon Content (defined below), Submitted Content (defined
        below) or any other Site feature. You acknowledge that any reliance on such material and/or systems will be at
        your own risk. Full Moon is not responsible for the information, data, text or other materials that may appear
        in Submitted Content or may otherwise be submitted by users. Opinions expressed in Submitted Content do not
        necessarily reflect the opinions of Full Moon, and Full Moon does not endorse and has no control over Submitted
        Content. Submitted Content is not necessarily reviewed by Full Moon prior to posting and Full Moon makes no
        warranties, express or implied, as to the Submitted Content or to the accuracy and reliability of the Submitted
        Content. Full Moon makes no representations regarding the amount of time that any Full Moon Content or
        Submitted Content will be preserved.

        Full Moon disclaims any warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, as to any matter whatsoever relating
        to this Site, including without limitation the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose. Full Moon
        is not liable or responsible for any damages or injuries caused by use of this Site (such as viruses, omissions
        or misstatements). THIS SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

    <h4>Web Site Access</h4>
    <p>A. Full Moon hereby grants you permission to use the Site as set forth in this Terms of Use, provided that: (i)
        your use of the Site as permitted is solely for your personal, noncommercial use; (ii) you will not copy or
        distribute any part of the Site in any medium without Full Moon's prior written authorization; (iii) you will
        not alter or modify any part of the Site other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Site for its
        intended purpose; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.

        B. In order to access some features of the Site, you will have to create an account. You may never use
        another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete
        information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your
        account password secure. You must notify Full Moon immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of
        your account. Although Full Moon will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your
        account, you may be liable for the losses of Full Moon or others due to such unauthorized use.

        C. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders,"
        "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Site in a manner that sends more request messages to the Full Moon
        servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a
        conventional online Web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Full Moon grants the operators of public search
        engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Site for the sole purpose of creating publicly
        available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Full Moon reserves
        the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest
        any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Site, nor to use the communication
        systems provided by the Site for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial
        purposes, any users of the Site with respect to their User Submitted Content.</p>
