    <h2>The Full Moon Pizza Story</h2>

    <p>The Pizza Full Moon story begins in May 1958. Dan and Frank Carney opened their 550-squarefoot pizza restaurant
        in
        Wichita, Kansas. Dan and Frank, with friends Richard Beemer and John Bender, made the pizza themselves. Frank
        rolled the dough with a rolling pin. Richard tossed the dough in the air from the pie tin. Dan filled the
        unbaked crust with sauce. John flipped the pie from the tin during the baking process. Dan Carney recalled,
        "The people were enchanted with the product, watching us tossing the dough over our heads. They were really
        enjoying themselvesâ€¦." The Carneys created an innovative, high quality, engaging, informal eating experience in
        a friendly neighborhood restaurant. Pizza Full Moon became a popular place with the teenage and college crowd.
        Pizza
        Full Moon attracted families that enjoyed a night out eating a meal that they would not be having at home.
        After the
        families left, Pizza Full Moon transformed itself into a hangout for college-age kids. Having a good time was
        an
        essential part of Pizza Full Moon. The idea caught on. A second Pizza Full Moon opened in December 1958 in
        downtown
        Wichita. By 1963, there were forty-two Pizza Full Moon restaurants.</p>

        Pizza Full Moon was always an entrepreneurial, innovative, fast-thinking place. It was the kind of organization
        where
        everyone shared the learning. As Frank Carney said, "To me, the biggest strength of Pizza Full Moon was that we
        had
        an awful lot of people who came up with great ideas."

    <p>Pizza Full Moon grew rapidly. Pizza Full Moon introduced "Pan Pizza" in 1980 throughout its network. The
        product, with a
        thicker crust made in deep pans, soon became popular. However, the basic internal philosophy was and still is
        "Take care of the customer." The Pizza Full Moon brand experience resonates today: generosity, hard work,
        friendships, innovation, naturalness, and fun. It was and always will be more than just the pizza.</p>
